Now Guide for VDC first Time Setup.

* Make Sure both Cluster name are different ..when it was created..else would create problem.
* Make sure the cephdata storage name is SAME on both Cluster..plus both are replication or erasure code 

## for Replication code sample
echo "starceph" >  /etc/webmin/vdcsitemanager/ceph-storage-name
echo "0" >  /etc/webmin/vdcsitemanager/ceph-erasure-code
### for Erasure code sample
echo "cephdata" >  /etc/webmin/vdcsitemanager/ceph-storage-name
echo "1" >  /etc/webmin/vdcsitemanager/ceph-erasure-code


* Now setup one-time ssh-auto login to all site1 PVE & site2 PVE for autologin 
  from not only each other but also from this VDC VM.
  This for Inter Process and to trigger root process for data sync.
Example
ssh-copy-id root@192.168.30.112
and check with ssh root@192.168.30.112 it should login auto

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Login from All PVE Servers of Site1 Cluster to each server of Site2 Cluster PVE
* Login from All PVE Servers of Site2 Cluster to each server of Site1 Cluster PVE
* Login from VDC VM to each server of Site1 Cluster PVE
* Login from VDC VM to each server of Site2 Cluster PVE

#ssh-copy-id root@site1
#ssh-copy-id root@site2

* Now go do folder on VDC VM : 
cd /usr//local/src/vdcsitemanager-tools/manager-tools/
we need to create the Site Config for VDC to manage all Node via Webmin , so one time activity below.

## for Site1 any one ip
php onetime-site-build-for-manager.php 1 192.168.30.113
## for site2 any one ip
php onetime-site-build-for-manager.php 2 192.168.40.144

Now Login to Webmin of VDC (example 192.168.40.30)
https://192.168.40.30:833
login : manager
password from : /usr/local/src/manager-vdcmanager-pass
